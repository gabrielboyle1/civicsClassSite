        <p>My main goals are focused on building a strong foundation for a future career that combines service, education, and mental health. First, I am working towards completing my IB and OSSD diploma, with a focus on Biology and Chemistry. These diplomas will give me the academic skills and discipline I need to succeed in post-secondary education. At the same time, I want to join the Ontario Provincial Police Auxiliary Constabulary program. This program will give me practical experience in law enforcement and community service, without taking on a full police role. After that, I plan to study at Western University to prepare for medical residency at UdL with a focus on psychiatry. This way, I can mix my passion for science with helping people facing mental health challenges.

Each of these goals fits together like stepping stones. They bring me closer to a career where I can make a real difference. I want a life where I use discipline and empathy equally. These goals will help me build the knowledge and skills to do just that.</p>

        <p>Looking back on my progress, I can say that feedback has played a huge role in helping me improve. When I first started coding this website, I did not know much about clean HTML or CSS. But feedback from others showed me why good structure and style matter. This pushed me to rewrite and improve my code to make it easier to use and nicer to look at. This project became a practical way for me to develop my digital skills, not just learn theory. &#10;&#13;
In school, feedback on my essays and projects helped me find ways to be clearer and think deeper. These comments improved my writing and critical thinking. I have also reached milestones like finishing the most credits I could in a year and landing my first job. These successes gave me confidence and motivation. I realized that progress is not only about big jumps. It is about steady effort and reflecting on how to get better.

I am learning to see feedback as a tool for growth rather than criticism. Whether it is a coding tip or advice about managing my time, I am changing from just finishing tasks to doing them better each time. This way of thinking feels like real growth.</p>

      <button class="collapsible">üõ£Ô∏è Where to Next?</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>For the future, I want to build on my momentum with clear purpose. One big step will be networking. I plan to reach out and connect with professionals in policing and medicine. These connections will help me find internships and mentors. They will give me a real look at these fields beyond books and classes. I also want fresh feedback from people already working in these careers.

At the same time, I will keep improving my skills. That means learning more about coding, updating my resume often, and applying to youth internships and programs that relate to my interests. By doing this, I will keep moving forward toward my goals with intention and action.>
